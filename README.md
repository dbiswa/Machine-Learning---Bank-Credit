# Machine Learning - Bank Credit Data

## Introduction

The goal of this project is to a build a model to predict bank accounts that go into default. The model can be used for more accurate evaluation of bank loan applications. The credit data was collected from UCI machine repository (http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/machine-learning-databases/statlog/german/). According to the data documentation, the dataset contains 1000 instances and 20 attributes. The original data set contains a mixture of categorical/symbolic and numeric attrubites. The description of the symbolic attributes are provided in the data documentation. 

The project is divided into 3 steps: 1. Data Collection and management; 2. Exploratory Analysis; 3. Data modeling and evaluation.
